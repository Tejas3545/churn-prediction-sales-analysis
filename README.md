# Churn Prediction, Sales Analysis & AI Applications 📊🤖

## 📌 Overview
This project was completed as part of my **Data Science & Analytics Internship at Zidio (June 2025 – September 2025)**.  
It focuses on **customer churn prediction, sales data analysis, and AI-driven applications**.  

The key objectives were:
- Predict customer churn using machine learning models.  
- Analyze sales data to uncover insights and patterns.  
- Explore simple AI/NLP applications (spam detection & chatbot).  

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning** (missing values, categorical encoding, normalization).  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with visualization of churn trends and sales insights.  
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Random Forest  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- **Model Evaluation** using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.  
- **Sales Analytics** (trend analysis, seasonal patterns, product-level performance).  
- **AI Applications**:
  - Spam message detection demo.  
  - Rule-based chatbot prototype.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (3.x)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK (for NLP demo)  

---

## 📊 Results & Insights
- Built churn prediction model with strong performance on test dataset.  
- Visualized key sales trends and identified high-performing product categories.  
- Developed prototypes of spam detection and chatbot systems.
