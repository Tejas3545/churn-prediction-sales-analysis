# Churn Prediction, Sales Analysis & AI Applications

## Overview

This repository contains the work completed during my **Data Science & Analytics Internship at Zidio (June 2025 â€“ September 2025)**.
The project focused on three main areas:

1. **Customer Churn Prediction** â€“ identifying customers at risk of leaving using machine learning models.
2. **Sales Analysis** â€“ understanding sales performance, trends, and patterns through data visualization.
3. **AI Applications** â€“ experimenting with small AI/NLP use-cases such as spam detection and a simple chatbot.

The aim was to gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and business insights.

## Project Highlights

* Cleaned and preprocessed structured datasets.
* Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover key trends.
* Built and evaluated **ML models** such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.
* Visualized **sales trends** including seasonal effects and product-level performance.
* Developed demo applications in **NLP** (spam message detection and rule-based chatbot).

## Tools & Technologies

* **Languages:** Python (3.x)
* **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, nltk
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Other tools:** GitHub for version control and documentation

## Results & Insights

* Built a churn prediction model that correctly identifies high-risk customers.
* Generated clear **visual insights** into sales patterns and product performance.
* Demonstrated how AI can be extended into **practical use cases** like spam filtering.

## Learning Outcomes

* Strengthened practical skills in **data preprocessing, visualization, and ML model evaluation**.
* Applied **NLP concepts** in small prototypes.
* Learned how to structure and document a complete data science project professionally.

## Future Work

* Deploying the churn prediction model as a **web application (Flask/Streamlit)**.
* Building a **dashboard** for real-time churn and sales insights.
* Exploring **deep learning methods** for better performance on larger datasets.
